## SECTION D: CANNIBALIZATION & DUPLICATION CHECK

### Potential Cannibalization Risks

**Query-to-URL Mapping:**

| Query | Primary URL | Risk Level | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|
| "hedge trimming Hobart" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Low | Primary target |
| "hedge maintenance" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Low | Primary target |
| "hedge cutting service" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Low | Covered in content |
| "garden hedge trimming" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Low | Covered in content |
| "hedge shaping Hobart" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Low | Covered in section |
| "residential hedge trimming" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Low | Covered in section |
| "commercial hedge trimming" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Low | Covered in section |
| "garden maintenance Hobart" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Medium | Primary focus on hedge trimming, but garden maintenance mentioned |
| "hedge pruning" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Low | Covered in content, differentiated from trimming |
| "hedge trimming cost Tasmania" | `/services/hedge-trimming/` | Low | Covered in pricing section |

**Near-Duplicate Targets:**

1. **Garden Maintenance vs Hedge Trimming**
   - Risk: "Garden maintenance" queries might compete
   - Resolution: Hedge trimming is primary focus, garden maintenance mentioned as related but not primary
   - Monitor: If garden maintenance queries grow significantly, consider separate page

2. **Hedge Pruning vs Hedge Trimming**
   - Risk: Pruning queries might overlap
   - Resolution: Content clearly differentiates trimming (appearance) vs pruning (health/structure)
   - Current: Appropriate differentiation

3. **Residential vs Commercial**
   - Risk: Separate queries for residential/commercial
   - Resolution: Both covered in single page with clear section differentiation
   - Current: Appropriate coverage

**Cannibalization Prevention:**
- Use consistent primary keyword per page
- Avoid exact keyword repetition across pages
- Use semantic variants appropriately
- Monitor search console for keyword cannibalization signals
