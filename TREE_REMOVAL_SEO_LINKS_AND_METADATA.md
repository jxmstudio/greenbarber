## SECTION D: CANNIBALIZATION & DUPLICATION CHECK

### Potential Cannibalization Risks

**Query-to-URL Mapping:**

| Query | Primary URL | Risk Level | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|
| "tree removal Hobart" | `/services/tree-removal/` | Low | Primary target |
| "tree removal services" | `/services/tree-removal/` | Low | Primary target |
| "tree lopping Hobart" | `/services/tree-removal/` | Medium | Include in content, but consider separate page if volume grows |
| "emergency tree removal" | `/services/tree-removal/` | Low | Covered in section |
| "arborist Hobart" | `/services/tree-removal/` + `/about/` | Medium | Split focus: services vs. about |
| "tree removal cost" | `/services/tree-removal/` | Low | Covered in pricing section |
| "large tree removal" | `/services/tree-removal/` | Low | Covered in section |
| "certified arborist Tasmania" | `/about/` + `/services/tree-removal/` | Medium | Split appropriately |

**Near-Duplicate Targets:**

1. **Tree Lopping vs Tree Removal**
   - Risk: Tree lopping queries might compete
   - Resolution: Include tree lopping content in Tree Removal page, but position Tree Removal as primary solution
   - Monitor: If tree lopping queries grow, consider separate page

2. **Emergency Tree Removal**
   - Risk: Emergency queries might need separate page
   - Resolution: Strong section in Tree Removal page, link from homepage emergency CTA
   - Monitor: If emergency queries dominate, consider dedicated page

3. **Arborist Services**
   - Risk: Generic "arborist" queries split between About and Services
   - Resolution: About page focuses on credentials, Services pages focus on specific services
   - Current: Appropriate split

**Cannibalization Prevention:**
- Use consistent primary keyword per page
- Avoid exact keyword repetition across pages
- Use semantic variants appropriately
- Monitor search console for keyword cannibalization signals
